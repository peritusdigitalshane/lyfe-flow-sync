## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Security Fixes (CRITICAL - BEFORE LAUNCH)
1. **Review and fix RLS policies** for all sensitive tables
2. **Enable leaked password protection**
3. **Update database version** for security patches
4. **Fix remaining authentication issues**

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (CRITICAL - BEFORE LAUNCH)  
1. **Fix email processing queue** - 113 stuck emails
2. **Test complete email workflow** end-to-end
3. **Verify automatic processing** is working
4. **Test threat intelligence integration**

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (BEFORE LAUNCH)
1. **Security audit** of all data access patterns
2. **Performance testing** under load
3. **Backup and recovery** procedures
4. **Monitoring and alerting** setup

## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT LAUNCH WITH PAYING CUSTOMERS** until:

1. ‚úÖ All 4 critical data security vulnerabilities are resolved
2. ‚úÖ Email processing system is working 100% reliably  
3. ‚úÖ Complete end-to-end testing passes
4. ‚úÖ Security audit confirms no data exposure risks

**Estimated time to production-ready: 1-2 days of focused fixes**
